This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

This is a React Application, built with Next JS. Compiled statically and exported as a Single page app (SPA). It can be deployed and hosted on any service capable of delivering HTTP responses, including Google Cloud CDN, Amazon CloudFront, and Heroku.

You can run it locally like this:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the application.

You can start editing the main page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Deploying to Production
``` bash
npm run build
```

This compiles the project and generates an `/out` directory. The contents of this should be deployed entirely.
